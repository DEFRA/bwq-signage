Additional improvements were made to the sewerage system to reduce the frequency of storm and emergency overflows, particularly at the Black Rock outfall. Further improvements in sewage treatment standards and a large increase in storm water storage capacity at Weston-super-Mare were completed in April in 2013. \nThe Environment Agency work with Wessex Water to carry out a review of sewerage performance within the Weston-super-Mare area, and will continue to make recommendations for further improvements to protect and improve the bathing water quality.", "_lang" : "en"}

The animal contribution is possibly more significant in the River Axe, and the human contribution more significant in the Uphill Great Rhyne. \nBetween 2009 and 2013 the Environment Agency have walked the catchment in wet and dry weather conditions, and sampled various tributaries of the Uphill Great Rhyne.  In 2011, the Environment Agency identified a chronic sewer leak into the Uphill Great Rhyne, promptly fixed by Wessex Water. The aim of these investigations is to help pinpoint polluters and pollution problems, and improve bathing water quality.

Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain.
