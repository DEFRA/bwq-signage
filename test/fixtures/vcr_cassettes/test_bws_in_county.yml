The Environment Agency have regularly inspected and sampled surface water outfalls.\nAs with many bathing waters close to urban centres, significant proportion of bathing water pollutants originate from poor practices by local residents, businesses and visitors. The Environment Agency has worked closely with Sedgemoor District Council on several public engagement activities since 2012 to promote best practice and reduce the impact of misconnections, poorly disposed of sanitary products, pet waste and other issues that block sewers or directly contaminate bathing water. \nIn 2016 the Environment Agency, Sedgemoor District Council, Wessex Water and Dorset Coastal Forum are supporting the 'Litter Free Coast & Sea Somerset' project led by Severn Estuary Partnership to engage tourists and the Burnham community on bathing water issues and solutions.", "_lang" : "en"}

Misconnections occur when waste water pipes are plumbed into surface water drains instead of the foul water sewerage system. This can give rise to pollution when the waste water is discharged directly to the environment through the surface water drain. For example, a washing machine or toilet may be incorrectly plumbed so that it discharges to the surface drain rather than the foul sewage drain.\nThe Environment Agency has identified many misconnected local properties across the catchment, and continues to work with Wessex Water to locate and rectify these problems.", "_lang" : "en"}

The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the rivers.

The main tributaries of the Parrett are the rivers Isle, Tone, Yeo and Cary. The Tone joins the tidal Parrett 30km inland at Burrowbridge. The River Cary rises at Castle Cary and flows west into the man-made King\u2019s Sedgemoor Drain at Henley Corner. It continues across the Somerset Moors and joins the tidal River Parrett downstream of Bridgwater at Dunball Sluice. \nThe River Huntspill is a man-made river in the Sedgemoor district of the Somerset Levels that joins the River Parrett just south of Highbridge. The river was built to act as a long reservoir to provide an all year-round supply of water for the Royal Ordnance Factory near Puriton, as well as to help drain parts of the lower Brue Valley. \nThe River Brue rises in Somerset and falls quickly in a narrow valley to a point just beyond Bruton where it is joined by the River Pitt. To the northeast of Glastonbury, the Brue is joined by various man-made drainage channels before entering the Bristol Channel. \nThe catchment is mostly rural, with urban areas making up only five per cent of the total.

The rivers flow north and west into the extensive low-lying floodplain of the Somerset Levels and Moors through various man-made drainage channels to the Severn Estuary at Bridgwater Bay. The steep catchment means rain runs off rapidly into the rivers. Rivers and other streams in the Somerset Levels are controlled by sluices which manage the volume of freshwater entering Bridgwater Bay\nThe River Parrett is 60km long and flows through Dorset and Somerset to its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea. The main tributaries of the Parrett are the rivers Isle, Tone, Yeo and Cary. The Tone joins the tidal Parrett 30km inland at Burrowbridge. The River Cary rises at Castle Cary and flows west into the man-made King\u2019s Sedgemoor Drain at Henley Corner. It continues across the Somerset Moors and joins the tidal River Parrett downstream of Bridgwater at Dunball Sluice. \nThe River Huntspill is a man-made river in the Sedgemoor district of the Somerset Levels that joins the River Parrett just south of Highbridge. The river was built to act as a long reservoir to provide an all year-round supply of water for the Royal Ordnance Factory near Puriton, as well as to help drain parts of the lower Brue Valley. \nThe River Brue rises in Somerset and falls quickly in a narrow valley to a point just beyond Bruton where it is joined by the River Pitt. To the northeast of Glastonbury, the Brue is joined by various man-made drainage channels before entering the Bristol Channel. \nThe catchment is mostly rural, with urban areas making up only five per cent of the total. The majority of the land is used for large scale agriculture, with more than 50 farms.", "_lang" : "en"}
